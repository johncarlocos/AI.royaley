# ROYALEY - AutoGluon Dependencies
# ============================================
# AutoGluon is optional but recommended for best ML accuracy
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-autogluon.txt
# Note: Adds ~2GB to installation
# ============================================

# AutoGluon Tabular (main package for structured data)
autogluon.tabular>=1.0.0

# Ray for parallel fold training (3x faster bagged model training)
# Without ray, AutoGluon trains 8 folds sequentially which is very slow
# AutoGluon 1.5.0 requires ray >=2.43.0,<2.53.0
ray>=2.43.0,<2.53.0

# Note: autogluon.tabular includes:
# - XGBoost
# - LightGBM
# - CatBoost
# - Neural Networks (PyTorch)
# - FastAI
# - Multi-layer stack ensembling
