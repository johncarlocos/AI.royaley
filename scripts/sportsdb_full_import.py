SportsDB Full Import - Populates ALL tables from TheSportsDB
Run: docker exec royaley_api python scripts/sportsdb_full_import.py

Tables populated:
1. teams - All team rosters
2. venues - Stadiums/arenas  
3. players - Player rosters
4. games - Historical (10yr) + Upcoming + Past results

Order matters:
- Teams must exist before games can reference them
- Sport records must exist (already in DB)
